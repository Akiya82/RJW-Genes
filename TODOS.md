# ToDos and Planned Genes 

I have many ideas but not too much time / knowledge of Rimworld or Modding. 
So any help is very appreciated, even if it is just pointing me to existing similar projects. 

## Planned Genes 

**Sanguophage like Cumwhores** adding Hemogen and refilling it by getting semen. 
Showstopper here is the amount of code required, and that I need to understand a bit better of harmony to run the AfterSexUtility and modulate SexChances. 

**MechBreeder** hetch mechanoids without harm. 
Showstopper: The damage to the pawn is hardcoded in MechBirth, so I might want to do a Deathstasis like Hediff after

**InsectBreeder** pawn fertilizes the insect eggs in his partner

**InsectIncubator** increase amount of eggs that fit inside pawn. 
Issue is that the MaxEggSize and Eggsize have hardcoded criteria, mostly around pawn size.
This might need a small change in RJW base code to split the function up with parameters (e.g. MaxEggSize)

**Traits** such as Hypersexual and LikesCumflation, Sexuality Genes?

**Modulation of FluidAmount** for Cocks and Tiddies

**Immunity to Soreness / Ignoring Cumflation Mali** 

## Animal Gene Inheritance 

It should be doable to have a per-category list of genes that a child can inherit on bestiality. 
Just roll for the available genes and add them to the kid.

Issues: 

- I do not know how to access babies genes from pregnancy 
- I did not (yet) find categories in the game such as *canine* or *equine*. 
- To have genes, the baby needs to be non-baseliner to the best of my knowledge (maybe make bestiality babies hybrid)

## Genes with Abilities and more Effects 

There were some suggestions on the Discord I saved them somewhere else. I am far away from making that work, but to have them here: 

- Genitalia deal damage as per size 
- Genitalia can cause Terror
- Cumshot Sniper Abilities
- Healing Pussy
