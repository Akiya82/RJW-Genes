# ToDos and Planned Genes 

I have many ideas but not too much time / knowledge of Rimworld or Modding. 
So any help is very appreciated, even if it is just pointing me to existing similar projects. 

## Planned Genes 

**Sanguophage like Cumwhores** adding Hemogen and refilling it by getting semen. 
Showstopper here is the amount of code required, and that I need to understand a bit better of harmony to run the AfterSexUtility and modulate SexChances. My first attempt exploded on adding UI Elements.

**Adjustable Cock-Size** like e.g. artificial genitalia have

**Infectious Hypersexuality Gene** (Maybe?) add Hypersexuality Gene through sex with a certain chance. 

**Cum Addiction** add Cum-Addiction from Sexpererience, slowly loose conciousness while addiction is not attended.

**Cum-Drugs** eating cum has an effect similar to Go-Juice (including (separate?) addiction)

**More Orgasm Boost** currently only does sleep, other things could be cool here too. Maybe a separate hediff boosting movement or fight. 

**Self-Fertilizing Eggs** Pawns fertilize eggs that are put inside them (with themselves as a parent)

## Animal Gene Inheritance 

It should be doable to have a per-category list of genes that a child can inherit on bestiality. 
Just roll for the available genes and add them to the kid.

Issues: 

- I do not know how to access babies genes from pregnancy 
- I did not (yet) find categories in the game such as *canine* or *equine*. 
- To have genes, the baby needs to be non-baseliner to the best of my knowledge (maybe make bestiality babies hybrid)

## Genes with Abilities and more Effects 

There were some suggestions on the Discord I saved them somewhere else. I am far away from making that work, but to have them here: 

- Genitalia deal damage as per size (on normal sex-use)
- Genitalia can cause Terror (as ability)
- Cumshot Sniper Abilities
- Healing Pussy

## Things to add/change for base-rjw 

(Bit dependable on RJW-Core people)

1. Make Racegroup-Defs accessible and non-private [This file here](https://gitgud.io/Ed86/rjw/-/blob/master/1.4/Source/Common/Helpers/RaceGroupDef_Helper.cs)
2. Make [this](https://gitgud.io/Ed86/rjw/-/blob/master/1.4/Source/Common/Helpers/Gender_Helper.cs#L316) not warn, to reduce errors towards users
