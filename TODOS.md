# ToDos and Planned Genes 

I have many ideas but not too much time / knowledge of Rimworld or Modding. 
So any help is very appreciated, even if it is just pointing me to existing similar projects. 

## Planned Genes 

**Sanguophage like Cumwhores** adding Hemogen and refilling it by getting semen. 
Showstopper here is the amount of code required, and that I need to understand a bit better of harmony to run the AfterSexUtility and modulate SexChances. 

**Immunity to Soreness / Ignoring Cumflation Mali** 

**LicentiaLabs TransferNutrition _Generous Donor_** pawns that get head do not loose nutrition or only part of what they fire. 

**Adjustable Cock-Size** like e.g. artificial genitalia have

## Animal Gene Inheritance 

It should be doable to have a per-category list of genes that a child can inherit on bestiality. 
Just roll for the available genes and add them to the kid.

Issues: 

- I do not know how to access babies genes from pregnancy 
- I did not (yet) find categories in the game such as *canine* or *equine*. 
- To have genes, the baby needs to be non-baseliner to the best of my knowledge (maybe make bestiality babies hybrid)

## Genes with Abilities and more Effects 

There were some suggestions on the Discord I saved them somewhere else. I am far away from making that work, but to have them here: 

- Genitalia deal damage as per size 
- Genitalia can cause Terror
- Cumshot Sniper Abilities
- Healing Pussy
