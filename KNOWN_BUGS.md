# Known Bugs 

Collection of Known Bugs and reasons for their origin. 

## Random Vaginas for Goblins 

Someone on 4Chan mentioned that his goblins with *huge schlong* gene spawned with vaginas despite having the No-Vagina Gene. 
The No-Penis and No-Vagina Genes are called Gender specific and only called for males and females. 

That is a bit weird, but I see 2 different reasons: 

- The player had futa-settings on in RJW
- The race has a change in sexualizer 

I could also have fucked shit up but then I need proper bug reports. 

## Full-No-Genital-Genes get Genitals later 

If you go with Full-No-Genitals (No Penis, No Anus, No Breasts, No Vagina) then the pawn spawns without any Genitalia on the map, 
however then the RJW base-logic runs the sexualizer. 

**Workaround**: Have atleast 1 genitalia enabled with Genes, I recommend the anus.
