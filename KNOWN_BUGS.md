Collection of Known Bugs and reasons for their origin. 

## Random Vaginas for Goblins 

Error: Pawns have different genitalia than expected, e.g. if the "no vagina" gene is specified there are pawns with vaginas AND a penis. 

Possible causes: 

- The "Male Female Only Genes" from Steam 
- A Futa generated by RJW 

Solutions: 

I added my own Male/Female only genes, taking Genitalia and Order in Account. Yet there was no issue with this. 

Maybe you can also fix it by changing `<DisplayOrderInXenotype>` in the Male/Female only Genes of the Steamworkshop, to be higher than the ones about genitalia. This way, the gender should be changed before my genes fire. 


## Full-No-Genital-Genes get Genitals later 

Error: I added all "no-XXX" genes but my pawn has genitalia on map!

Reason: If you go with Full-No-Genitals (No Penis, No Anus, No Breasts, No Vagina) then the pawn spawns without any Genitalia on the map, 
however then the RJW base-logic runs the sexualizer. 

**Workaround**: Have atleast 1 genitalia enabled with Genes, I recommend the anus.
