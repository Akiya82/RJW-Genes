# Known Bugs 

Collection of Known Bugs and reasons for their origin. 

## Random Vaginas for Goblins 

Error: Pawns have different genitalia than expected, e.g. if the "no vagina" gene is specified there are pawns with vaginas AND a penis. 

Possible causes: 

- The "Male Female Only Genes" from Steam 
- A Futa generated by RJW 

Solutions: 

I added my own Male/Female only genes, taking Genitalia and Order in Account. Yet there was no issue with this. 

Maybe you can also fix it by changing `<DisplayOrderInXenotype>` in the Male/Female only Genes of the Steamworkshop, to be higher than the ones about genitalia. This way, the gender should be changed before my genes fire. 


## Full-No-Genital-Genes get Genitals later 

Error: I added all "no-XXX" genes but my pawn has genitalia on map!

Reason: If you go with Full-No-Genitals (No Penis, No Anus, No Breasts, No Vagina) then the pawn spawns without any Genitalia on the map, 
however then the RJW base-logic runs the sexualizer. 

**Workaround**: Have atleast 1 genitalia enabled with Genes, I recommend the anus. 

## Log Pops up for Xenotypes with Female/Male Only Gene 

Error: 

When using a Xenotype with the Female only gene, upon refresh it can open the log with the following (red) statement: 

```
[RJW]  ChangeSex error (PAWNNAME) faction (FACTION). Probably tried to change sex at world gen for royalty implant, skipping
UnityEngine.StackTraceUtility:ExtractStackTrace ()
Verse.Log:Error (string)
rjw.ModLog:Error (string)
rjw.GenderHelper:ChangeSex (Verse.Pawn,rjw.GenderHelper/Sex,rjw.GenderHelper/Sex)
rjw.GenderHelper:ChangeSex (Verse.Pawn,System.Action)
RJW_Genes.Gene_FemaleOnly:AdjustPawnToFemale ()
RJW_Genes.Gene_FemaleOnly:PostMake ()
RimWorld.GeneMaker:MakeGene (Verse.GeneDef,Verse.Pawn)
[... some more ...]
```

Reason: 

RJW covers some corner cases when the pawn is changed before creation. 

Current Solution: 

Ignore this. The pawns seem to have the right sex and genitalia, I cannot "catch" the exception as it is only a Log Error. I would need to do harmony patching and ... that seems to be too much.  

Aimed Solution: 

Patch ChangeSex to skip for pawns with the two genes producing this.

## Insect Breeder does not fertilize

Error: 

A pawn with insect breeder fucks a pawn with unfertilized insect eggs, but the eggs stay unfertilized. 


Notes: 

So testing this is super hard. 

One thing - you need to have anal or vaginal sex for this to work. Any other sex type is currently not supported. 

For anything else, please help me gather information on this what you did and how things look. I reworked it once but I think it should work now.
